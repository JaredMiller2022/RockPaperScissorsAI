# RockPaperScissorsAI

Description:
I designed the AI from playing the AI made by The New York Times, and logically thinking through what would beat it. The AI I created will not win every round, and will not work correctly against an opponent playing randomly, but will gain an advantage over a human opponent over time.

How To Play:
The files must be added into an IDE running on java. Then, run the program and follow the outputs/enter your inputs in the console.
